## Order Status Classification (Python)

This project demonstrates a clean Python function that classifies orders
based on order amount, number of items, and VIP customer status.

### Concepts covered:
- Conditional logic (if / else)
- Boolean values
- Multiple function parameters
- Clean code structure

This is part of my Python learning journey.
